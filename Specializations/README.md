# Specializatons

In this section of the repo I organize and collect for you some **Specializations**. They are optional but highly recommended, and you need them in order to expand day-by-day your skillset and your expertise.

You can take them in order or choosing the one that most fits to you and your inclinations, but **I recommend you** to walk through them all at least once.

I've planned two type of Specializations: 

- Data Specializations 
  - Data Preprocessing **Now under construction**
  - Data Collection [Coming Soon - Next]
  - Data Visualization [Coming Soon]
  

- SoftSkills Specializations 
  - Effective Communication [Coming Soon]
  - Impactful Presentations [Coming Soon]
  - Pragmatic Decision Making [Coming Soon]

The former are about Data (you don't say?) and they truly are _the core toolkit_ of everyone working with data. To work with data is an art by some point of view, and rules of thumbs and best practices will help you understanding the right way to treat them, but also you need to  develop a "sense" of what to do with the data, and this "sense" is mostly driven by the situation and the experience. Because of that, these specializations will be strongly focused on exercises and practice.

The latter are about... everything that's not written in technical books. Take and master them, because they are the real _value enabler_ for you. You can be the best developer or engineer of the world, but If you can't communicate your data to your audience, or use data to suggest practical action in the real world, you're useless for a company. 

So, stay tuned because I'm constructing this section during weekends and free time, and I hope to provide you at least one specialization each week!
