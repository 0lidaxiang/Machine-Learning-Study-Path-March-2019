# Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing (also known as Data Preparation, but "Preprocessing" sounds more magic) is the process of gathering, combining, structuring and organizing data so it can be analyzed as part of data visualization, analytics and machine learning applications.

Real-world data is often incomplete, inconsistent, and/or lacking in certain behaviors or trends, and is likely to contain many errors. Data preprocessing is a proven method of resolving such issues.

It' the core ability of any data scientist or data engineer, and you must be able to manipulate, clean, and structure data during you everyday work (besides expecting that this will take the most of your daily-time!).

There are a lot of differente data types out there, and they deserve different treatments.

As usual the structure I've planned to get you started consists of having a general overview first, and then dive deep into each data processing situation you can encounter. 

The concepts through which we're going are are the following:

- Data Quality 
- Work Hard To Produce High Quality Data
- Business Questions
- Data Profiling
- Who To Leave Behind
- Start Small
- Data Cleaning
  - Get Rid of Extra Spaces
  - Select and Treat All Blank Cells
  - Convert Values Type
  - Remove Duplicates
  - Change Text to Lower/Upper Case
  - Normalize Data
  - Spell Check
  - Standardize Data
  - Delete all Formatting
  - Dealing with Special Characters
  - Normalizing Date Formats
  - Finding and Replacing Patterns
  - Verification to enrich data
  - Data Cleaning Tools
- Data Exploration
- Merge Data Sets
- Data Discretization
- Data Scaling
- Data Integration
- Iteratively Cleanse and Filter
- Sanity Check
