# Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing (also known as Data Preparation, but "Preprocessing" sounds more magic) is the [iterative process](http://www.jsoftware.us/vol12/306-JSW15277.pdf) of gathering, combining, structuring and organizing data so it can be analyzed as part of data visualization, analytics and machine learning applications.

[Real-world data](https://www.quanticate.com/blog/real-world-data-analysis-in-clinical-trials) is often incomplete, inconsistent, and/or lacking in certain behaviors or trends, and is likely to contain many errors. Data preprocessing is a proven method of resolving such issues.

It's the [core ability](https://blogs.sas.com/content/hiddeninsights/2017/11/30/analytical-data-preparation-important/) of any data scientist or data engineer, and you must _be able to manipulate, clean, and structure_ your data during the everyday work (besides expecting that this will take the most of your [daily-time](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3228245/the-80-20-data-science-dilemma.html)!).

There are a lot of differente data types out there, and they deserve different treatments.

As usual the structure I've planned to get you started consists of having a general overview first, and then dive deep into each data processing situation you can encounter. 

The concepts through which we're going are are the following:

- Data Quality 
- Work Hard To Produce High Quality Data
- Business Questions
- Data Profiling
- Who To Leave Behind
- Start Small
- Data Cleaning
  - Get Rid of Extra Spaces
  - Select and Treat All Blank Cells
  - Convert Values Type
  - Remove Duplicates
  - Change Text to Lower/Upper Case
  - Normalize Data
  - Spell Check
  - Standardize Data
  - Delete all Formatting
  - Dealing with Special Characters
  - Normalizing Date Formats
  - Finding and Replacing Patterns
  - Verification to enrich data
  - Data Cleaning Tools
- Data Exploration
- Merge Data Sets
- Data Discretization
- Data Scaling
- Data Integration
- Iteratively Cleanse and Filter
- Sanity Check
