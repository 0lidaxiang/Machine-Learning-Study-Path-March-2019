Hi, i'm Giacomo. 

I'm an Italian student currently having a stage in a shiny Machine Learning and AI startup in Bologna, and I want to share my learning path and my love for the technology with you.

This repository is intended to provide three **complete and organic learning paths** for the following fields:


- Machine Learning

- Business Intelligence (coming soon)

- Cloud Computing (coming soon)


You will understand both theory and be able to apply it in practice, with hands-on projects.

If carefully followed they will bring you to a complete awareness and expendable skill from scratch. 

In fact, they does not require any previous knowledge, but being confident with programming and high school math is necessary to understand and implement most of the concepts.

Every source listed here is **free or open source**.
