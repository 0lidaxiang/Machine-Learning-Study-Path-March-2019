This repository is intended to provide three **complete and organic learning paths** to getting started with Machine Learning, Business Intelligence and Cloud Computing.

You will understand both theory and be able to apply it in practice, with hands-on projects.

Every source listed here is **free or open source**. 

It does not require any previous knowledge, but being confident with programming and high school math is necessary to understand and implement most of the concepts.
